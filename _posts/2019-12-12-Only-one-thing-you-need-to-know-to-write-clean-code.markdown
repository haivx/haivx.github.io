So this time we'll talk about clean code. But I have deadline, I've no time for clean code. So you know we run into this all the time where we on deadline pressure, our project manager, our clients are telling us that we've got to get this done by friday, you're working long hours and the common outcome of this is the big ball of mud code, the fast and dirty code to get something done. 

<!-- more -->
So we're asked to go faster but what happened if we actually going slower. Hmm, there are more bugs that we have to go back and fix them we're finding needles in haystacks getting the work done actuaaly takes longer than if we adjust written clean code to begin with slowly. 

So the idea here is an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so how do we know this. There's actually been studies that have done studies that have been done watching actually programmers work how are they spending their time and the ratio of times and reading code versus writing is well over ten to one. 

People are actually spending most of their time scrolling up and down in a file looking for something, and "no it's not they are open another file oh it's not there either"... What am I where is this thing I'm trying to fix the actual time you spend typing is a lot less than the time you spend just looking around. So if you take the time to make your code easy to read you will be make the code easier to write.

So the important thing you need to know is `you are responsible for the quality of your code`, not your client, not your boss.

If you think about other professions doctors, lawyers, accountants,...they all have professional standards that they adhere to. You don't go to the doctor and say you know what doc I'm in alright want to just skip washing your hands, you know go to your account and say why don't you just skip the double-entry bookkeeping why are you bothering with that. Let's go you know we have certain respect for people in these professtions and respect how they work. 

So if we want to be treated as professionals we have to act like professionals, we have to be advocates for the quality of the code that we write and advocate for doing it the right way and not accept the option to do it the wrong way to where a young feel them to me that's very exciting to be part of defining what these professional standards are and it's up to us to create them not our clients, not our project managers. That's all.

But how should I do. Do you want it? Go for it. The choice is yours.

Happy hacking!
